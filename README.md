Beats, Advanced Rhythm Game
=====

Popular, open source rhythm game for Android.
This is the latest snapshot of the SVN code base (r18), migrated to GitHub.
This is the final release of Beats and the subsequent open sourcing of the code. The decision was made to not open source Beats until now due to the extremely messy and disorganized nature of the code (just about every feature since Beats 1.0a is an ugly hack). While Beats is now under a modified BSD license, please do NOT fork the original source code, for sanity reasons. The source code should be used for reference purposes only.

Random guy on the internet who didn't follow the above advice and decided to fork a dead project here. I use this app almost every day to play Stepmania files on my phone and it's great, but it crashes nonstop on my phone and its missing a few features. When I was learning about android development last year, I saw that this app was open source and decided to try and add a few faster speed settings. From there it snowballed to "fixing" the main menu crash myself and a lot of other people have been having to adding song banners to the song selection screen. I plan to add a few more features, but due to school and me having almost no programming experience, updates may be scarce. Also, for some reason I decided to remove osu! song support, don't ask (I went a bit to far removing stuff one day). Thank you so much Keripo for making the only mobile game I find worth playing and I hope a few other people find this and enjoy it as well. Also, somewhere along the way android studio changed the entire folder structure.
